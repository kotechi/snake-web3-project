📘 Project Description

Snake Web3 is a blockchain-based competitive Snake game built on the Stellar Soroban network.
Players join competitions by paying an entry fee using tokens, play to achieve the highest score, and compete for a prize pool. The top three winners share rewards, while the admin receives a small percentage.
The game integrates Web3 wallet connection, smart contract interaction, and on-chain leaderboard tracking.

🌍 Vision

The vision of Snake Web3 is to redefine casual gaming by connecting it with real digital ownership and fair rewards.
Through simple yet competitive gameplay, it introduces players to blockchain in an engaging, transparent, and decentralized way.
This project aims to inspire a future where every game move has real value, empowering both developers and players in the Web3 world.
